I am a **Staff Software Engineer** at ServiceTitan, where I focus on the synergy between robust .NET architectures and the evolving landscape of AI. 

Currently, I'm developing **LLMValidator**, a library that rethinks data validation beyond traditional regex by leveraging generative AI. I also write about the intricacies of distributed systems, such as managing GUIDs vs Snowflake IDs at scale, and implementing database encryption in Clean Architecture.

This blog documents my deep dives into C#, system design, and the practical application of LLMs in modern engineering.
